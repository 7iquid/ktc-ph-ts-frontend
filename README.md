# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

ito nalang sir..

Gawa ka ng isang Fullstack app na nagpapakita ng weather forecast for today  using the following:

- Weather API(https://www.weatherapi.com/) -> where weather data comes from

- Front-End: React with State Management (Context API) Don't use Redux for this one.

- Backend: Your language and framework choice.

- Database: MongoDB

Requirement:
1. Use best practices.
2. All components should be modular and reusable.
3. Apply Google Analytics.



Git repo should be Github
Kissy
Invite me sa repo nalang so I can see all the changes.

Kissy Kissa
backend and front end have separate repo

Lastly, create documentation for the Whole App and for the API endpoints..
Kissy
Endpoints should be secured.

can't be access anonymously

use BEM method for scss
haha ayan sir.. wala naman deadline.. pero time by time matututunan mo yung basic ng real world scenario.. ganito ang cons, pag nasimulan mo yan ng pangit na code, mahihirapan ka kasi on the middle need mo iadjust yan sa much better way, may time na magcoconflict sa foundation ng code mo at wala kang choice kundi ulitin from scratch.. Beware sa ganun sir hahaha tuwing may changes ka mag create ka ng Pull Request, tapos iaapprove ko..
